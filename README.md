This project takes 7-zip distribution from mirror downloads for distribution using maven central.

For more information on 7-zip, please see [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)

# Motivation #

7-zip does not currently provide a maven central distribution of the project. This project aims to solve that by providing users an alternative location to pull distribution.

# Use Case #

Maven based storage of distribution in common location to offer more secure download location.
